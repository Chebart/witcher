# Fanfic game "Witcher3.Wild hunt."
Hi, I'm Chebart, it's my first project on GitHub.

# About the project.
It's the first part(main menu) of fanfic game "Witcher3.Wild hunt". I use Python and pygame to create the main menu. I created this project 4 months.

It is full main menu. You can use active buttons and sliders to interact with audio,video,gameplay,interface settings. 
Also, there are 2 languages: English and Russian. Moreover, you can turn up or down music and sounds. 
Animation has 32 frames.I drew all pictures usung Adobe Photoshop.

# Warning
You need to install Python and pygame, move all files in one folder.

# How to start the game
You need to open folder "Build" and click on file named witcher.exe and start it.

I hope you really enjoy it!
